  abstract = {Considering the growing concern with solid wastes problems and the pressing need for a holistic approach to their management, this study developed a literature review about the subject ``Zero Waste''. To that end, a systematic literature review was executed, through which 102 published articles were analyzed with the aim to, initially, comprehend the concept of Zero Waste, and, then, map its benefits, challenges, and critical success factors. The results show that scholars have not reached a consensus regarding the concept of ZW. While some studies fully address this philosophy, other studies are based on just one or on some of its topics. The benefits were grouped and organized into four dimensions: benefits to the community, financial-economic benefits, benefits to the environment and benefits to the industry and stakeholders. As to the challenges, barriers were identified both in the macro environment (mainly political and cultural) and in the meso and micro environments (stakeholders, industries, and municipalities). The analysis of the articles enabled listing critical success factors, supported by a set of activities that must be carried out. Regarding future studies, it is worth noting that more empirical studies about ZW implementation are necessary, particularly with regard to educational practices designed to promote changes in user behavior.},

The diverse and growing body of international zero waste experience, can be portrayed as both, an entirely new and alternative waste management paradigm, and or, interpreted as overlapping, extending, and synergetic with a general evolution towards more sustainable waste/resource management practices. Combining the terms zero and waste provokes creative, intellectual, and pragmatic tensions, which provide a contemporary axis for necessary debate and innovation in this sphere of resource management. This commentary draws on an interdisciplinary perspective and utilises some elements of the critique of zero waste, as a lens to examine and better understand this heterogeneous global community of practice. In particular, how the concept and implementation of a zero waste goal can increase community engagement and be a catalyst for the design and management of a more circular urban metabolism and hence, more adaptive, resilient, and sustainable future (zero waste) cities.},

Solid waste has become one of the global environmental issues. Continuous depletion of natural finite resources is leading the globe to an uncertain future. To prevent further depletion of global resources, sustainable consumption and a strategic waste management system would be required. One approach that has been suggested as a means of addressing these concerns is that of the concepts of ``Zero Waste''. However, transforming currently overconsuming activities into zero waste is still challenging. In this study, the challenges of solid waste (focusing on industrial waste e-waste, food waste and packaging waste), zero waste practices, and zero waste strategy were discussed to analyze the challenges and opportunities to transform traditional waste management toward zero waste vision. ``Zero Waste'' is a good solution to minimizing the increasing solid waste. However, in order to minimize the solid waste, there are still more endeavors need to be done in future.},

The traditional waste management focusing on waste utilization and disposal is unable to unravel the continuous depletion of finite natural resources. ``Zero waste'' as an integrated waste management method to promote waste reduction through a pack of strategies such as cleaner production and green consumption has emerged. Here, we systematically reviewed the researches on zero waste from a scientometric perspective, and visually unveiled the most productive countries, evolution process, main authors, major research areas, and documents of zero waste research domain. The results show that with increased publications, zero waste has become a multidisciplinary study area and food waste reduction is the biggest sub-network in zero waste research. The current research frontiers are mainly regarding ``lean production,'' ``consumer behavior,'' ``productivity.'' Accordingly, this study proposed a pathway for realizing zero waste cities with three lanes: (1) research and development, (2) management method, and (3) policy and implementation. The findings are also expected to be beneficial to latecomer researches in the waste management field.},

The aim of this research is to gather information on packaging in the sustainability context to provide a systemic view of the contents, to identify opportunities, and define guidelines for packaging design. A systematic literature review of 472 papers was performed. The first step was a bibliographic search using Pack *, Sustainab *, and eco * as keywords. Secondly, the content analysis revealed the emergence of nine categories grouped in four clusters. These categories and nineteen subthemes were considered research opportunities. Going beyond the coding units of the content analysis, we have used context units to propose (i) the gathering of technical procedures to support the design phases of sustainable packaging; and (ii) the proposition of a framework based on the life cycle stages and design phases. At last, we have provided insights and guidelines that can be useful for packaging professionals.},

  abstract = {Our planet is faced with numerous social and ecological challenges that we have to resolve as soon as possible through a combination of innovative ideas implemented under local conditions. One of the biggest challenges for many startups, retail chains and consumers themselves is packaging waste reduction that involves activities mainly aimed at waste prevention. The targeted impact of sustainability information on consumers' purchase intentions plays a key role in shaping their future decision-making, and Slovak market is no exception in this regard. A relatively new concept of ``zero waste'' in relation to packaging waste prevention directly during shopping has been given the green light thanks to behavioural changes among many Slovak eco-conscious consumers. The main aim of presented paper is to determine the level of environmental awareness among Slovak consumers basing on the results of marketing research on their shopping habits. The present paper also focuses on the current situation with zero-waste stores as a newly developing concept for Slovak market. In order to meet the objectives of this paper, own marketing research has been conducted (covering 783 respondents from Slovak Republic). For statistical processing of the results, we have used Levene\textasciiacute s test, Bartlett\textasciiacute s test, KolmogorovSmirnov test and Chi-Square test of independence. The research findings confirm that consumers' experiences, awareness and sustainable shopping habits are at a good level but there are significant differences in attitudes across generations, genders and places of living.},

It is concluded that ecological fallacy effects are endemic to areal census data, although their magnitude is perhaps not as large as might have been expected. The principal difficulty is that there is at present no way of predicting in advance the degree of severity likely to be associated with particular variables and particular techniques. Finally, a suggestion is made concerning how the potentially serious practical consequences can be reduced.},

However, the simultaneous advent in the last 15 years of low cost computing and the increasing availability of retail related data of all types has given retailers the opportunity to take a much more rational approach to decision making. This paper examines the extent to which retailers have taken advantage of the potential released by these developments, and adopted more ``scientific'' rules based methodologies. The analysis is based on an extensive questionnaire survey of UK retailers conducted in 1998 which encompassed organisations operating altogether more than 50,000 outlets across eight sectors. The survey sought to identify the use made both of particular types of techniques, and of Geographical Information Systems, which act as a platform for them. It was complemented by a series of in-depth interviews with location specialists in a number of major retail organisations.},

  abstract = {Zero waste is a visionary concept for confronting waste problems in our society. The idea is being developed and implemented in various sectors including waste management and treatment, mining, manufacturing, and urban development. The zero waste concept has been embraced by policymakers because it stimulates sustainable production and consumption, optimum recycling and resource recovery. Professionals in waste management systems, however, perceive and apply it in different ways. This study aims to conceptualize zero waste development based on a critical review of available academic journal publications. Very few studies have been found in the domains of zero waste design, assessment and evaluation that have examined production, and sustainable consumption. This study reveals that the scope of the zero waste studies is diverse, and a zero waste concept is constantly developing through various programmes, plans, policies and strategies. The findings of this review study suggest that the zero waste programmes are applied in many countries without any holistic zero waste strategy. The study emphasizes that countries might be able to achieve zero waste goals by developing a national zero waste strategy and by integrating and promoting zero waste initiatives (in communities and industry) through waste management policy. This article presents a critical review of the major studies conducted by researchers on zero waste in the last decades. Based on the review findings the study concludes that zero waste concept has been applied widely in different phases of production and waste management systems. The findings of the study assist to identify priority areas of zero waste strategy and to develop national zero waste guidelines. Thus, this study can be useful to policy and decision makers in developing the evidence-based zero waste guidelines.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Global municipal waste production causes multiple environmental impacts, including greenhouse gas emissions, ocean plastic accumulation, and nitrogen pollution. However, estimates of both past and future development of waste and pollution are scarce. We apply compositional Bayesian regression to produce the first estimates of past and future (1965\textendash 2100) waste generation disaggregated by composition and treatment, along with resultant environmental impacts, for every country. We find that total wastes grow at declining speed with economic development, and that global waste generation has increased from 635 Mt in 1965 to 1999 Mt in 2015 and reaches 3539 Mt by 2050 (median values, middle-of-the-road scenario). From 2015 to 2050, the global share of organic waste declines from 47\% to 39\%, while all other waste type shares increase, especially paper. The share of waste treated in dumps declines from 28\% to 18\%, and more sustainable recycling, composting, and energy recovery treatments increase. Despite these increases, we estimate environmental loads to continue increasing in the future, although yearly plastic waste input into the oceans has reached a peak. Waste production does not appear to follow the environmental Kuznets curve, and current projections do not meet UN SDGs for waste reduction. Our study shows that a continuation of current trends and improvements is insufficient to reduce pressures on natural systems and achieve a circular economy. Relative to 2015, the amount of recycled waste would need to increase from 363 Mt to 740 Mt by 2030 to begin reducing unsustainable waste generation, compared to 519 Mt currently projected.},
